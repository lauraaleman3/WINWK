      <div class="content">This is the glorious text-content!</div>
    </div>

    <!-- // // TASK1: 
// Add the following elements to the container using ONLY javascript - do not add any HTML or CSS code.

// 1. a <p> with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”
// 2. an <h3> with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”


// 3. a <div> with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:

// 4. another <h1> that says “I’m in a div”

// 5. a <p> that says “ME TOO!”

// Hint for this one: after creating the div with createElement, append the <h1> and <p> to it before adding it to the container. -->

    <!-- ...............TASK 2.............
   In this task we provide you with a constructor. We want you to:
    // 1) Add a new method to the Shape class's prototype, calcPerimeter(), which calculates its perimeter (the length of the shape's outer edge) and logs the result to the console.
    
    // 2) Create a new instance of the Shape class called square. Give it a name of square and a sideLength of 5.
   
    // 3. Call your calcPerimeter() method on the instance, to see whether it logs the calculation result to the browser DevTools' console as expected.
   
    // 4. Create a new instance of Shape called triangle, with a name of triangle and a sideLength of 3.
   
    // 5. Call triangle.calcPerimeter() to check that it works OK. -->
